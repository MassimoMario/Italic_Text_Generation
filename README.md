# Generating text in three italic language styles: _Dante, Italian_ and _Neapolitan_, using a cVAE based on RNNs  üñãÔ∏èüìñ
Pytorch implementation of Text Generation.

The goal of this project is to generate text in _Dante, Italian_, and _Neapolitan_ language style, using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder where both Encoder and Decoder are Recurrent Neural Networks.
The VAE is conditioned using style labels, following this idea:

IMMAGINE

Taken from . . .

Basically a one-hot encoded label is projected into _latent space_ dimensions and added to the latent variable in order to decode an output belonging to that style label.

During inference phase the model decodes a sentence starting from  $z \sim \mathcal{N} _ {0, 1}$ + projected (given) label.


I took in consideration 3 models:
* **RNN cVAE**: both Encoder and Decoder are RNN
* **GRU cVAE**: both Encoder and Decoder are RNN with GRU units
* **LSTM cVAE**: the Encoder is a LSTM and the Decoder a GRU


The Word Embedding layer has been initialized using a Word2vec model.

The three text corpus taken in consideration for training are:
* **Dante**: _Divina Commedia_
* **Italian**: _Uno, nessuno e centomila_ by Luigi Pirandello, and _I Malavoglia_ by Giovanni Verga
* **Neapolitan**: _Lo cunto de li cunti_ by Giambattista Basile

# Usage
First clone the repository:

```bash

# Results
Here's some example sentences generated by each model in three styles:

_**Dante**_:

_RNN cVAE_: 

_GRU cVAE_:

_LSTM cVAE_:

_**Italian**_:

_RNN cVAE_:

_GRU cVAE_:

_LSTM cVAE_:

_**Neapolitan**_:

_RNN cVAE_:

_GRU cVAE_:

_LSTM cVAE_:



To quantify the accuracy in generating sentence with a given style, an independent CNN Classifier has been trained to detect the generated style from the models.

The **SA**, Style Accuracy, and **PPL** $= 2^{- \frac{1}{N} \sum_i log_2 \left( P(w_i)\right)}$, Perplexity, are here reported for the three models:

| Model | SA | Average PPL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RNN cVAE | 91.96 % | 37.41 | 
| GRU cVAE | 96.00 % | 23.43 | 
| LSTM cVAE | 99.43 % | 37.53 | 


Here's the training curves for the three models:
