# Generating text using a RNN - based VAE in three italic language styles: _Dante, Italian_ and _Neapolitan_ 🖋️📖
Pytorch implementation of Text Generation.

The goal of this project is to generate text in _Dante, Italian_, and _Neapolitan_ language style, using a Variational Autoencoder where both Encoder and Decoder are Recurrent Neural Networks.

The Word Embedding layer has been initialized using a Word2vec model.

The three text corpus taken in consideration for training are:
* Dante: _Divina Commedia_
* Italian: _Uno, nessuno e centomila_ by Luigi Pirandello, and _I Malavoglia_ by Giovanni Verga
* Neapolitan: _Lo cunto de li cunti_ by Giambattista Basile
